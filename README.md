# basic_combat
This is an initiative tracker for D&amp;D 5e.  I suppose it could be used for other editions, but I only play 5e, and know next to nothing about the others, so I'm not sure if I'm missing anything vital from them.  This project was partially made to help practice using Swing, so while I know it could be done better using other methods, it shall stay this way for some time.
